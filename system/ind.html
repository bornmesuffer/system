                Dolmayan first became interested in drums at the age of two. His father was a saxophone player and when his mother would take him to watch his father play, he would mimic his father's drummer. He learned to play the drums by putting on records and practicing for hours a day, and continued said practice for years.
                Dolmayan describes his musical style as one influenced by whatever he could get his hands on, including the jazz albums belonging to his father and the rock albums he shared with his friends. <br/>

On his social media accounts, Dolmayan is very politically active like his bandmates, but unlike some members of System of a Down, particularly Tankian, Dolmayan supported Donald Trump's presidency. Tankian has stated that it is "frustrating" to be politically opposite with his bandmate and brother-in-law.
A long time comic book fan, Dolmayan owns a comic book shop, Torpedo Comics, in Las Vegas, Nevada.

            <p>Toxicity is the second studio album by Armenian-American heavy metal band System of a Down, released on September 4, 2001, through American Recordings and Columbia Records. Expanding on their 1998 eponymous debut,
            it incorporated more melody, harmonies, and singing than the band's aforementioned album. Categorized primarily as alternative metal and nu metal, Toxicity features elements of multiple genres including folk, progressive rock, jazz, Armenian music and Greek music, including prominent use of instruments such as the sitar, banjo, keyboards, and piano.
                 It contains a wide array of political and non-political themes, such as mass incarceration, the CIA, the environment,
                  police brutality, drug addiction, scientific reductionism, and groupies.
                Toxicity was recorded at Cello Studios in Hollywood, California. Over 30 songs were recorded, but the band narrowed the number of songs on the album to 14. 
                The album peaked at number one on both the Billboard 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart, sold 220,000 copies in its first week of release, was certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in November 2002, and has sold at least 2,700,000 copies in the United States.
                 All of Toxicity's singles reached the Billboard Hot 100. The final single, "Aerials", went to number one on both the Mainstream Rock Tracks and the Modern Rock Tracks charts.
                 Toxicity received mainly positive ratings and reviews from critics, among them perfect ratings from AllMusic, Kerrang!, and Blabbermouth.net. Many critics praised the album's sound and innovation.

           <h4>Mezmerize</h4>
           <p>Mezmerize is the fourth studio album by Soad  released on May 17, 2005, by American Recordings and Columbia Records. Upon its release, the album received widespread acclaim from critics.

            At a length of just over 36 minutes, Mezmerize is the band's shortest studio album.
            Despite the time difference between releases, Mezmerize and Hypnotize were recorded within the same time frame. The album features guitarist Daron Malakian sharing most of the vocal work with vocalist Serj Tankian, splitting the vocals at least halfway on many of the tracks. In 2018, Malakian and Tankian both independently revealed that at the time of recording the two albums, Tankian was almost out of the band. According to Tankian, this was because of differences in creative input and financial revenue split.

Malakian wrote "Old School Hollywood" after playing in a celebrity baseball game for charity. The song mentions Tony Danza and Frankie Avalon, who also played in the game.
           <br/> The tracks of this album are Soldior Side - Intro, "B.Y.O.B." ("Bring Your Own Bombs"), Revenga, Cigaro, Radio/Video, This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm on This Song,
           Violent Pornography, Question!, Sad Statue, Old School Hollywood and Lost in Hollywood.

              <td><h4>B.Y.O.B.</h4>
              <td><p> 
                The day-to-day used acronym B.Y.O.B. usually stands for "Bring Your Own Beer/Beef" . In this case it should be Bring Your Own Bombs.
After the intro the song starts with the rhetorical shrieked question “Why do they always send the poor?” and at the end it is changed into the exclamation “They always send the poor!” which criticises the exorbitant high number of poor people mostly with a low level of education in the US army. As “B.Y.O.B.” is naturally used in the context of garden parties is this song directly addressed to George W. Bush who should fight this war on his own and not by soldiers. This impression is emphasised by “Why don’t presidents fight the war?” (which can also be seen as presidents should fight to stop war) and “Where the ---- are you?” so he should bring his own bombs to the “party” in the “desert”.
The Bush-administration and a bigger part of the American population believe that other parts of the world (which includes the Iraq) are underdeveloped and a kind of “barbarian” but by behaving like this the Bush-administration is barbarian (“Barbarism by barbaras”). This line also refers to Barbara Walters, a famous news presenter, dressed “with pointed heels” who shows the bright side of war, an act of propaganda.
The war itself has been won by the allies because they have the better and more modern equipment ("Victorious, victorious steel") and the <span id="dots">...</span><span id="moreB">industry of arms is happy because they sell their weapons (“For brand new spankin’ deals” – can also interpreted that the young, poor soldiers make “good” deals by joining the army because now the state pays for their college fees, many poor people do that to have the chance to get an education, of course it’s a good working method of the army to get new recruits).
“Marching forward hypocritic and hypnotic computers” hints again at the modern technology and its abuse (“hypnotic computers”), misuse as a concealment of facts and that people are manipulated by the media and the soldiers are “marching forward hypercritic” and shoot everything they see before thinking about it (friendly fire) or “marching forward hypocritic” (as the band writes it) which would implicate that this war is lead by hypocritical reasons.
“You depend on our protection” is the first ironical sentence which criticises that the official reason for this war was to protect the Iraqi population and the world against Saddam Hussein but the real cause was oil. Along with this goes “Yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth” alluding to the faked satellite pictures and other “proves” that justified the war and the uneducated part of the population, who has to fight the war, believes this because they don’t know better.
The chorus again is very ironical, exploding bombs look like a sunset which explains the phrase “blowing up the sunshine”. Again we can find the analogy of war and party “Everybody is going to the party have a real good time”. Furthermore this criticises the military ads to gain young soldiers in which war is presented more like having a good time and making a lot of friends. “Dancing in the dessert” is an anti-thesis. The way the chorus is sung with the happy “la la la” beforehand criticises the glorification of wars and that the American population does not get the cruel reports about soldiers in Iraq.
“Kneeling roses disappearing” refers to the destruction of nature by wars. Furthermore is “roses” a synonym for soldier because they look like roses when their jackets are constricted by the belts. It also can be seen as Muslims kneeling on the ground and praying to God – as an effect of war they disappear because they get killed.
They chose Moses because he led Israel out of Egypt – an alliteration to Bush who sees himself as God-like and the USA always supports Israel. His mouth is dry (“Moses’ dry mouth”) because in the dessert water and food is narrow. This can also hint at the American industry which is always thirsty and addicted to oil.
Fort Knox is a symbol for money and the American economy, “breaking into Fort Knox” then stands for 9/11 which was an assault against America and the global economics and stole “their intentions” – mainly money.
“Hangers sitting dripped in oil crying freedom” can be the Iraqi population screaming for help and to attract this they are “dripped in oil” which makes them pretty attractive for industrial nations because they desperately need oil for their economy. The impression arises that the Iraqi population did not want this kind of freedom the US wants to give them (being the supplier for oil and having a puppet government) as “freedom” is sung very ironical.
“Handed to obsoletion” stands for the reason of this war because oil is an antiquated technology and thus criticises this war of economical reasons and to save the old technology based on oil.
The bridge describes the beginning of the war, imagine Bush saying “Let’s got start this war” – “Blast off, it’s party time”. Then comes irony again, (“We’re not living in a fascist nation”) on one hand the US army is going to free the Iraq of a dictatorship and a fascist ideology but on the other they do not realize that the US itself is fascistic to a certain extend, racisms still exists in many minds - who can think of a black president?
